# EzWOEID
Once apon a time, a developer had stumble on a huge challenge call @TwitterAPI, he//she had no idea what woeid and how could he/she find the resources/data for it.

It turns out that the predecessor @Yahoo has use this ID to locate the region throughout the world. Although, sadly, as sad as it may sounds, @Yahoo had been detrimented
these days and obviously not have enough resource to maintain their geo API page

After digging enough for pulling out a json file that include over 400 different locations, I have decided to be a saviour to myself, and hopefully to another people out there trying to figure out
how the heck they suppose to find it.

The project focus on connecting to mongoDB and setting up backend, in the future, I am planning to create RESTFUL API like https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ for user to freely trying things out
